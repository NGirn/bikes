# Bikes project

This is my bikes project based on [this bikes challenge](https://github.com/jujhars13/dev-test-frontend)

We're going to use Javascript with jQuery, HTML5 and css to build our page to render bikes.
## ToDo

- Create a plan
- implement 
- deploy


## To run locally

```bash
# our temporary webserver
docker run -it -p 80:80 -v ${PWD}/app:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

```
