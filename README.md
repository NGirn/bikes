# Bikes project

This is my bikes project based on [this bikes challenge](https://github.com/jujhars13/dev-test-frontend)

We're going to use Javascript with jQuery, HTML5 and css to build our page to render bikes.

## ToDo

- get jquery onto page
- load in bikes.json
- get a list of bikes (titles only) onto the page
- commit and save code


## To run locally

```bash
# our temporary webserver
docker run -it -p 80:80 -v ${PWD}/app:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```


## notes

OpenWeathermap.
